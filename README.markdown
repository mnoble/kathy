=====

kathy is a WebSockets based chat client. It's still just an experiment
but it mostly works quite smoothly.

Usage
-----

    ./server/bin/kathy [--port=9876]
    open index.html

If you run the server on a port other than +1234+ or a host other than +0.0.0.0+, you'll have to change +lib/kathy.js+ to reflect the correct URI.
